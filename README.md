# Insult Bot

Insult Bot looks for messages from people and only responds if someone sends a message with a keyword in it. When pinged or referenced, Insult Bot will reply back as a chatbot!

You can restrict the bot to specific channels using the `/setchannel` command. With Premium, you can add custom triggers/insults, set the bot to only include custom triggers/insults, and get unlimited access to the chatbot feature.
